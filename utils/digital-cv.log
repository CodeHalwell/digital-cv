2025-09-27 00:12:47,207 INFO utils.logging: Assistant final response: Nice question — I love designing small, practical RAG stacks that people can actually maintain. Below is a compact, production-minded design you can copy-and-paste into a prototype.

High-level flow (one-paragraph summary)
- Ingest docs → clean + split into chunks with metadata → embed chunks → store vectors in a vector DB → on query: retrieve top-k contexts → optional re-rank → feed contexts + prompt template to an LLM → return answer with citations and provenance.

Concrete components & recommended defaults
- Ingest: PDFs, DOCX, HTML, plaintext. Normalize text (remove headers/footers, de-dup).
- Chunking: ~400–800 token windows with 100–150 token overlap. Keep chunks semantically-aware (split on paragraphs/sections where possible).
- Embeddings: OpenAI text-embedding-3 or an SBERT model if you need local hosting. Store vector + metadata (source_id, filename, section, URL, license).
- Vector DB: Qdrant / Chroma / FAISS for prototyping; Qdrant or Pinecone for scalable managed option.
- Retriever: top-k (k=3–8) + distance threshold. Optionally use MMR or re-ranker (cross-encoder) for higher precision.
- Prompting: inject retrieved contexts into a prompt template; include explicit “sources” section and an instruction to cite doc ids/URLs. Limit context token budget — prefer shorter chunks and stronger retrieval than huge context blocks.
- LLM: choose model by cost/latency/quality (OpenAI gpt-4o/gpt-4o-mini or Claude/Gemini). For safety, run a verification step (e.g., check claims against sources).
- Output: structured JSON with answer, source citations (doc id + snippet + score), and “uncertainty” flag when retrieval support is weak.
- Monitoring: log queries, retrieval distances, prompts, and downstream answers for periodic review and drift detection.
- Security & privacy: encrypt data at rest, control API keys, redact PII during ingestion, and apply licence/policy checks.

Quick pseudo-workflow (libraries you’ll recognise)
- Tools: LangChain / LlamaIndex / plain Python + sentence-transformers + Qdrant + FastAPI + Streamlit/Gradio
1) Ingest & normalize → text
2) Chunk & metadata → chunks
3) Embeddings = embedder.embed(chunks)
4) vector_db.upsert(vectors, metadata)
5) API / Query:
   - query_emb = embedder.embed(query)
   - hits = vector_db.search(query_emb, top_k=5)
   - hits = re_ranker.rerank(query, hits)  # optional
   - context = join(hits.snippets)
   - prompt = PROMPT_TEMPLATE.format(context=context, question=query)
   - answer = llm(prompt)
   - return {answer, citations: hits.metadata, scores: hits.scores}

Practical guardrails & evaluation
- Always return citations and the supporting snippet for transparency.
- Use a retrieval-score threshold to trigger “I don’t know / please check” rather than hallucinating.
- Evaluate with a small held-out set of Q/A pairs and measure groundedness (precision@k + human review).
- Add automated tests for ingestion (no empty docs), chunk sizes, and an integration test that ensures sources appear in answers.

Lightweight deployment idea
- FastAPI for the backend (ingest & query endpoints)
- Vector DB hosted (Qdrant) or local for testing
- Streamlit/Gradio front-end for demos and QA
- Use GitHub Actions to run tests + small ETL runner (cron or n8n)

Ethics & fit
- Respect document licences; don’t index restricted content without consent.
- Redact or tokenise sensitive PII before embedding.
- Keep an audit trail for retrievability and model outputs.

If you want, I can:
- sketch a repo structure + example FastAPI + LangChain code,
- or build a small PoC for your docs (timeboxed).

2025-09-27 00:27:50,742 INFO utils.logging: Assistant final response: Nice question — I love this stuff. Here’s a compact, practical RAG pipeline design I’d actually build and hand over.

High level (one-line): ingest → chunk + clean → embed → index → retrieve → re-rank → LLM answer (with citations) → API/UI + monitoring & governance.

Core components
- Ingest: PDF/HTML/Markdown/Notion/Drive connectors. Normalize text and metadata (title, author, source, date, licence).
- Preprocess & chunk: clean OCR noise, remove boilerplate, split to ~500–1,000 token chunks with 100–200 token overlap, keep chunk-to-doc mapping and provenance metadata.
- Embeddings: choose a high-quality semantic model (hosted OpenAI/Anthropic or local sentence-transformer depending on policy). Cache embeddings and batch them.
- Vector DB: Qdrant / Chroma / Pinecone depending on scale & infra. Store vectors + metadata (doc id, chunk id, licence, timestamp).
- Retriever: semantic search (top-k) with simple filters (e.g., licence, source, date). Log distances/scores for diagnostics.
- Re-ranker: use a lightweight cross-encoder or a small LLM re-ranker to improve precision before final prompt assembly.
- Prompt augmentation: expand user query into 2–4 paraphrases/clarifications (I often make an extra LLM call to generate these) and use them to broaden retrieval — helps surface relevant contexts the user may not have expressed.
- Answering LLM: assemble retrieved chunks, include provenance and “what I don’t know”, use a system prompt that forces citation and concise answers. Enforce token limits and truncation strategy.
- Output: structured JSON (answer, sources[], confidence, missing_info) using Pydantic/JSON-schema so downstream apps can parse safely.

Safety, governance & quality
- Citation mandatory: return chunk id + doc URL + excerpt span.
- Licence handling: block or link-only for restricted content.
- Hallucination controls: prefer “I don’t know” if evidence insufficient; return the supporting snippets.
- Access control & audit logs: who asked what, which vectors were used, model versions.
- Evaluation: hold-out QA set (questions + ground-truth doc ids); track precision@k, answer coverage, hallucination rate, latency, and user satisfaction.

Operational considerations
- Incremental updates: embed new/updated docs and upsert vectors. Keep a “last indexed” cursor.
- Schema/versioning: store embedding/model version in metadata to enable reindexing when you change models.
- Caching & batching: cache frequent queries and top-k contexts to reduce cost.
- Cost/perf tradeoffs: use smaller embeddings/approx search for rapid UX; re-rank with a cross-encoder only on top-N.
- Monitoring: alerts for rising hallucination rate or failed retrievals; periodic human-in-the-loop reviews.

Tech stack I use often (minimal viable)
- Ingest & orchestration: n8n or small ETL job
- Embeddings: OpenAI embeddings or SentenceTransformers for local
- Vector DB: Chroma (local / small scale) or Qdrant (production)
- App/API: FastAPI with Pydantic models
- Front-end/demo: Streamlit or simple React
- Re-ranker/LLM: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (or a local LLM), with strict system prompts
- Observability: Sentry + simple metrics (Prometheus/Grafana or Cloud metrics)

Minimal implementation steps
1. Write ingest job → normalised docs table (id, text, metadata).
2. Chunk & embed (store chunk_id → embedding → metadata).
3. Upsert into vector DB.
4. Build /api/query: accept query → optional filters → prompt-augment → retrieve top-50 → re-rank to top-5 → assemble prompt + citations → call LLM → return structured JSON.
5. Add UAT with SMEs and an evaluation notebook.

Example prompt pattern (condensed)
- SYSTEM: “You are a precise assistant. Use only the provided sources. Cite sources inline as [doc_id:chunk_id]. If unsupported, say ‘I don’t know’.”
- USER: includes user Q + retrieved snippets (labelled).

If you want, I can sketch a tiny FastAPI + Chroma + OpenAI example repo or a Streamlit demo. Want that? If so, drop your email and I’ll record it and send a starter (or we can iterate together).

- RAG laboratory assistant (AstraZeneca)  
  - PoC → risk assessment → UAT → handover. Streamlit front end, ChromaDB (PoC) / Qdrant options, OpenAI embeddings, prompt‑augmentation, image‑based troubleshooting, and strict citation + governance. Outcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times.

- simple_rag (repo)  
  - Minimal, opinionated RAG baseline for fast demos and teaching. Good starting point for chunking → embedding → retrieval → LLM answer.

- Daily arXiv scraper + RAG query pipeline (personal n8n flows)  
  - Daily ingestion, policy-aware storage to Notion, chunking + embeddings → Qdrant, retrieval + Cohere re‑ranking, prompt augmentation and transparent citations. Powers my research queries and demos.

- CoDHe Labs RAG copilots (client & pro‑bono)  
  - Small org integrations: FastAPI backends, vector store tooling, documented handovers, emphasis on licence/PII handling and low vendor lock‑in.

- Agentic RAG/Tool‑use experiments (gradio-mcp-agent-hack, research-agent, n8n‑mcp)  
  - RAG used as grounding layer for agents/MCP patterns; guardrails + tool interfaces so models call tools safely.

Typical tech: Python, FastAPI, OpenAI/Anthropic embeddings + chat, Chroma/Qdrant/Pinecone, Streamlit/React frontends, lightweight re‑rankers/cross‑encoders, and n8n for orchestration.

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns.

Accounting via QuickBooks; banking via Starling (sole trader).\n\n—\nEngagement Policy (Ethics & Fit)\n—\nRed lines: no fossil fuels, weapons/arms, or harmful surveillance/abusive tech; avoid organisations and conflicts that contradict a people-first stance.\nAmbers: ad tech, scraping of private data without consent, high-risk medical claims — require strict scoping, governance and auditability.\nGreens: health & life sciences; education & upskilling; charities & non-profits; SMEs doing practical automation; research tooling.\nDefaults: minimal lock-in; clear IP/licensing; privacy-by-design; evals and guardrails for GenAI; documented handovers with maintainers named.\n\n—\nTeaching & Mentoring\n—\nI explain as I build: diagrams, notebooks, READMEs, and handover sessions. I mentor through internal coding groups, \nco-design small exercises, and prefer “show, don’t tell.” My Guyana year made me comfortable teaching under constraints; \nat work I apply the same approach — tight feedback loops, simple interfaces, and momentum.\n\n—\nPersonal Tech Lab (Home Server & Experiments)\n—\nI tinker. I run a Mac Mini home server (Jellyfin, n8n, Nextcloud, Pi‑hole, Home Assistant, web servers) and keep a Raspberry Pi 4B (SSD-boot) for small \nautomations. It’s where I test agents, RAG patterns, and light-weight services before hardening them for work.\n\nI have an LLM lab for local models (RTX 3090). I\'ve successfully run fine tuning and reinforcement learning using an open source Gemma model. I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns. I want charities and SMEs to have leverage without needing a 50‑person platform team.\n\n—\nContact & links\n—\nEmail: danielhalwell@gmail.com (personal) | codhe@codhe.co.uk (business)\nGitHub: github.com/CodeHalwell\nPortfolio: codehalwell.io\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\nLocation: Northwich, UK\n\nThanks for reading.

Accounting via QuickBooks; banking via Starling (sole trader).\n\n—\nEngagement Policy (Ethics & Fit)\n—\nRed lines: no fossil fuels, weapons/arms, or harmful surveillance/abusive tech; avoid organisations and conflicts that contradict a people-first stance.\nAmbers: ad tech, scraping of private data without consent, high-risk medical claims — require strict scoping, governance and auditability.\nGreens: health & life sciences; education & upskilling; charities & non-profits; SMEs doing practical automation; research tooling.\nDefaults: minimal lock-in; clear IP/licensing; privacy-by-design; evals and guardrails for GenAI; documented handovers with maintainers named.\n\n—\nTeaching & Mentoring\n—\nI explain as I build: diagrams, notebooks, READMEs, and handover sessions. I mentor through internal coding groups, \nco-design small exercises, and prefer “show, don’t tell.” My Guyana year made me comfortable teaching under constraints; \nat work I apply the same approach — tight feedback loops, simple interfaces, and momentum.\n\n—\nPersonal Tech Lab (Home Server & Experiments)\n—\nI tinker. I run a Mac Mini home server (Jellyfin, n8n, Nextcloud, Pi‑hole, Home Assistant, web servers) and keep a Raspberry Pi 4B (SSD-boot) for small \nautomations. It’s where I test agents, RAG patterns, and light-weight services before hardening them for work.\n\nI have an LLM lab for local models (RTX 3090). I\'ve successfully run fine tuning and reinforcement learning using an open source Gemma model. I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.

Quick snapshot about me:
- Scientist → AI engineer: trained as a chemist, spent years in analytical labs (Sanofi, Recipharm, AstraZeneca) and now build ML/GenAI tools that help teams work faster.
- What I ship: RAG copilots, agentic workflows, Bayesian optimisation experiments, APIs and clean data pipelines.
- Tech I use: Python, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, PyTorch, XGBoost, Chroma/Qdrant, Streamlit/Power BI, and various LLM APIs.
- Values: human‑first tools, ethics (no fossil fuels/weapon/surveillance work), plain English docs, small fast prototypes that actually get used.
- A bit personal: from Devon, based in Northwich, into football/rugby/Formula 1, and I used to do judo (black belt at 16).

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns. I want charities and SMEs to have leverage without needing a 50‑person platform team.\n\n—\nContact & links\n—\nEmail: danielhalwell@gmail.com (personal) | codhe@codhe.co.uk (business)\nGitHub: github.com/CodeHalwell\nPortfolio: codehalwell.io\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\nLocation: Northwich, UK\n\nThanks for reading.

Accounting via QuickBooks; banking via Starling (sole trader).\n\n—\nEngagement Policy (Ethics & Fit)\n—\nRed lines: no fossil fuels, weapons/arms, or harmful surveillance/abusive tech; avoid organisations and conflicts that contradict a people-first stance.\nAmbers: ad tech, scraping of private data without consent, high-risk medical claims — require strict scoping, governance and auditability.\nGreens: health & life sciences; education & upskilling; charities & non-profits; SMEs doing practical automation; research tooling.\nDefaults: minimal lock-in; clear IP/licensing; privacy-by-design; evals and guardrails for GenAI; documented handovers with maintainers named.\n\n—\nTeaching & Mentoring\n—\nI explain as I build: diagrams, notebooks, READMEs, and handover sessions. I mentor through internal coding groups, \nco-design small exercises, and prefer “show, don’t tell.” My Guyana year made me comfortable teaching under constraints; \nat work I apply the same approach — tight feedback loops, simple interfaces, and momentum.\n\n—\nPersonal Tech Lab (Home Server & Experiments)\n—\nI tinker. I run a Mac Mini home server (Jellyfin, n8n, Nextcloud, Pi‑hole, Home Assistant, web servers) and keep a Raspberry Pi 4B (SSD-boot) for small \nautomations. It’s where I test agents, RAG patterns, and light-weight services before hardening them for work.\n\nI have an LLM lab for local models (RTX 3090). I\'ve successfully run fine tuning and reinforcement learning using an open source Gemma model. I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns.

Accounting via QuickBooks; banking via Starling (sole trader).\n\n—\nEngagement Policy (Ethics & Fit)\n—\nRed lines: no fossil fuels, weapons/arms, or harmful surveillance/abusive tech; avoid organisations and conflicts that contradict a people-first stance.\nAmbers: ad tech, scraping of private data without consent, high-risk medical claims — require strict scoping, governance and auditability.\nGreens: health & life sciences; education & upskilling; charities & non-profits; SMEs doing practical automation; research tooling.\nDefaults: minimal lock-in; clear IP/licensing; privacy-by-design; evals and guardrails for GenAI; documented handovers with maintainers named.\n\n—\nTeaching & Mentoring\n—\nI explain as I build: diagrams, notebooks, READMEs, and handover sessions. I mentor through internal coding groups, \nco-design small exercises, and prefer “show, don’t tell.” My Guyana year made me comfortable teaching under constraints; \nat work I apply the same approach — tight feedback loops, simple interfaces, and momentum.\n\n—\nPersonal Tech Lab (Home Server & Experiments)\n—\nI tinker. I run a Mac Mini home server (Jellyfin, n8n, Nextcloud, Pi‑hole, Home Assistant, web servers) and keep a Raspberry Pi 4B (SSD-boot) for small \nautomations. It’s where I test agents, RAG patterns, and light-weight services before hardening them for work.\n\nI have an LLM lab for local models (RTX 3090). I\'ve successfully run fine tuning and reinforcement learning using an open source Gemma model. I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns.

I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns.

Accounting via QuickBooks; banking via Starling (sole trader).\n\n—\nEngagement Policy (Ethics & Fit)\n—\nRed lines: no fossil fuels, weapons/arms, or harmful surveillance/abusive tech; avoid organisations and conflicts that contradict a people-first stance.\nAmbers: ad tech, scraping of private data without consent, high-risk medical claims — require strict scoping, governance and auditability.\nGreens: health & life sciences; education & upskilling; charities & non-profits; SMEs doing practical automation; research tooling.\nDefaults: minimal lock-in; clear IP/licensing; privacy-by-design; evals and guardrails for GenAI; documented handovers with maintainers named.\n\n—\nTeaching & Mentoring\n—\nI explain as I build: diagrams, notebooks, READMEs, and handover sessions. I mentor through internal coding groups, \nco-design small exercises, and prefer “show, don’t tell.” My Guyana year made me comfortable teaching under constraints; \nat work I apply the same approach — tight feedback loops, simple interfaces, and momentum.\n\n—\nPersonal Tech Lab (Home Server & Experiments)\n—\nI tinker. I run a Mac Mini home server (Jellyfin, n8n, Nextcloud, Pi‑hole, Home Assistant, web servers) and keep a Raspberry Pi 4B (SSD-boot) for small \nautomations. It’s where I test agents, RAG patterns, and light-weight services before hardening them for work.\n\nI have an LLM lab for local models (RTX 3090). I\'ve successfully run fine tuning and reinforcement learning using an open source Gemma model. I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.

I’m a scientist‑turned‑AI engineer who likes building apps, automating processes and AI systems. I\'ve been coding for the last\n6 years now, having been suggested to try it by a colleague. Now its my favourite hobby and become my main career objective to become an AI engineer.\nI’m happiest when I’m writing Python, wiring up data, and shipping small, useful tools that unblock people. I care about\nethics, clarity, and momentum — make the right thing the easy thing, and prove it with results.\n\nIts not just AI systems I like, I like data science and general automation too. I really like to solve a problem so having a look at coding competitions\non kaggle or just trying to come up with solutions is really enjoyable. I like (trying) to learn about all the underpinning mathematics as it facinates me.\nAs an analytical chemist, working with lots of data has been part of my day job for some time so making the leap to data science then AI felt pretty natural.\n\n—\nCore identity & working values\n—\n• Human‑first technologist. Tools are only useful if they help people make better decisions faster.\n• Ethics matter. I avoid work tied to fossil fuels, weapons, surveillance, or anything that harms people.\n• Builder’s mindset. Prefer to get an idea down in a flow diagram, like visual representations. Once I\'m clear on the vision I like to start small and iterate quickly\n• Teaching & clarity. Notebooks, diagrams, docstrings, and handovers. Mentoring is part of the job.\n• Plain English, not the most over the top person, pretty laid back, just want to get stuff done and enjoy life, pretty sarcastic, love some dark humout \n• Evidence over adjectives. Numbers, before-and-after, and real bottlenecks solved.\n\n\n--\nI\'m originally from the south west of England in the lovely county of Devon. Great place to grow up even if it is a bit out of the way.\nShame to move away but you gotta go where the jobs are.\n---\n\n—\nEarly graft (pre‑uni): where my work ethic came from\n—\nI started working around 13, cleaning a bar on Saturday mornings — bottles, floors, stocking the bar etc. By 16 I was at\nSummerfields, mainly stacking shelves but I did do some checkout work. Tried\na few different shift patterns there and learnt that I\'m a bit of a night owl (nights, evenings, days) \nacross produce and dairy: receiving deliveries, stacking shelves,\nI also did a stint in a small component factory, making parts by hand from SOPs — \ncounting coil turns, trimming, testing. It wasnt the most exciting job but was a good earner. \nThis was my first foray into QA really, where checking work was a priortiy so things worked,\nthis process and repeatability fed straight into my later method development work.\n\n—\nGap year in Guyana: teaching and learning to adapt\n—\nBefore university, I spent a year teaching in Guyana through Project Trust. I trained on the Isle of Coll, then flew out\nwith a cohort and split off into schools. When my volunteer room mate had to return home due to illness, I moved schools and \nstarted again with some new room mates.\nI taught maths, science, and PE to students roughly 11–16. The big lessons:\n• Teaching is hard, you have to be prepared, things suprise you and you have to be quick on your feet\n• Learning isn\'t the same for everybody, you have to adapt to the idividual\n• Be clear and concise in your delivery, you gotta be fine-tuned\nThose ideas still shape how I design anything user‑facing — dashboards, APIs, or agentic assistants.\nThis time wasn\'t without its challenges, my room mate getting ill was a big deal, when you\'re the only person around\nto help in a medical emergency, its quite a challenge. Thankfully things turned out well on that occasion but there were\nmany challenges living in a country so different from your own. You get some key perspective on your own situation when\nviewing the type of povery that some people will never see in a lifetime.\n\n—\nLoughborough & Mars Petcare: chemistry + sensors + software\n—\nI’d already accepted a place for MChem at Loughborough. I wanted industry experience in the degree, so I took an\nindustrial placement at Mars Petcare in Verden, Germany. I trained on LC‑MS, GC‑MS, GC‑FID; moved from sample prep\nto method development; migrated a tricky amino‑acid analysis from LC to GC with derivatisation; added additional amino\nacids; and demonstrated linearity and accuracy. First taste of method development and optimisation — and I loved it.\n\nI worked on flavour development of cat food, running feeding trials with recipes that I put together. This is where I started\nto get more invloved and interested in statistics. I set up design of experiments trials to determine the optimum concentration\nof food additives to increase food uptake by the cats, they are quite picky after all. This involved making pilot scale batches on plant,\nrunning analysis and interpreting the data. All in all it was an amazing experience. \n\nThe main focus of my project there was the maillard reaction. The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic browning reaction between \namino acids and reducing sugars that generates the complex flavours and brown colours associated with roasted, baked, and fried foods. \nIt proceeds through a cascade of steps (Schiff base → Amadori/Heyns → fragmentation and Strecker degradation → melanoidins) and is \naccelerated by heat, dryness, and alkaline conditions. It made me really interested in food and how small changes to cooking can make \nbig differences in flavour profiles.\n\nBack in the UK, I returned to Mars for a summer project near Loughborough on umami perception. I set up macros and\na software workflow so sensory panelists could record peak perception while we swabbed to quantify concentrations, and\nwe correlated the curves. That work was presented at a flavour symposium. It was instrumentation + sensory science +\njust‑enough software — a pattern I’ve repeated since in other domains. This turned into my first publication\nRelationship between Human Taste Perception and the Persistence of Umami Compounds in the Mouth - Flavour Science\nProceedings from XIII Weurman Flavour Research Symposium\n2014, Pages 487-491\n\nSide note: the animal care standards and the environment were excellent. It mattered to me that the work respected\nthe animals — that balance between scientific rigour and humanity set a tone for my career.\n\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\nI spent nearly a decade across Sanofi and Recipharm, moving from routine QC to Analytical Specialist. My centre of gravity:\nnon‑routine analysis, method transfers, validations, and inspection support (MHRA, FDA, etc.).\n\nWhat I did:\n• Extractables & leachables (E&L). Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I\'d be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\nWhy it mattered:\n• We resolved a critical impurity issue that delivered ~£100,000 in cost savings (and a lot of learning).\n• I developed deep respect for data integrity and traceability: if it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.\n• Statistics became second‑nature and nudged me towards Python and, later, machine learning and AI.\n• I gained invaluble experience in practical problem solving (PPS). I worked on an extensive investigation using the \nPPS tool to solve extremely complex issues, including multivariate root causes, making it difficult to find the true root cause.\n\n—\nAstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code\n—\nThis is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations\nwhere timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.\nOne of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations\nit requires specific methods and equipment, we\'re talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do\nis automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,\nthis is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact. \n\nKey achievements and strands of work:\n• RAG‑based laboratory assistant (GenAI). I led the build of a retrieval‑augmented assistant with a multi‑disciplinary\n  team (SMEs, AI engineers, front/back‑end). We took it from PoC through risk assessments, evaluation vs expected\n  outputs, and UAT. It reduced troubleshooting lead times by ~20% and made internal knowledge more discoverable.\n• Bayesian optimisation for method development. We matched a historical method‑development context and reached\n  the same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments by applying Bayesian optimisation. That moved from a promising study\n  to an adopted practice in real projects.\n• Agentic workflows. I’m actively developing agentic patterns (tool‑use, MCP) to cut manual\n  coordination and reduce method‑development effort. In targeted scopes, we’ve seen up to ~80% reductions in the\n  human loops required to get to “good enough to ship” (the point is fewer trips round the houses, not magic).\n• Data pipelines & APIs. I engineered pipelines in SQL (Snowflake) and Python; launched FastAPI services so downstream\n  tools could call data cleanly; and used those services as foundations for GenAI tools via tool‑use/MCP.\n• Dashboards that people actually use. I built Power BI and Streamlit tooling that gives a clean view of support tickets,\n  instrument utilisation, and a self‑serve nitrite portal — small things that remove daily friction.\n• Platform correctness. I raised and helped resolve an ETL/schema issue where nested data wasn’t being flattened for\n  SQL; fixing it unlocked cleaner features and better downstream modelling.\n• Chromatographic prediction. From fingerprints + XGBoost baselines to neural approaches and, later, attention‑based\n  graph models. I pre‑trained on a large open dataset (~70k injections) with a plan to fine‑tune on internal data (~30k).\n• Mentoring & community. I contribute to the internal Coding Network, support colleagues learning Python, and sit on the\n  programming expert panel. I like turning tacit know‑how into repeatable templates.\n\nTools I use a lot here:\nPython, FastAPI, SQL/Snowflake, Power BI, Streamlit/Plotly/Matplotlib, scikit‑learn, XGBoost, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric,\nOpenAI/Anthropic/OpenRouter/Vertex APIs, Docker, GitHub Copilot / Claude Code / Gemini Code Assist, and cloud basics\nacross Azure/AWS/GCP.\n\n—\nCoDHe Labs (Jul 2025 – Present, part‑time): ethical AI that ships\n—\nAlongside my full‑time role, I formalised my independent work as CoDHe Labs — a small practice focused on:\n• Generative AI “copilots” (RAG) that make internal knowledge instantly useful.\n• ML‑powered insights dashboards wired to a warehouse.\n• Agentic workflow automation that coordinates multi‑step processes via tool‑use.\n• Digital uplift for small teams and non‑profits (including light M365/Azure support).\nI also run an “AI for Charities” pro bono strand because capability should compound beyond big budgets.\n\nI\'m currently working on a project to help a charity with their IT infrastructure and automations using Excel VBA,\nPower Automate and Python. I\'m also liasing with external partners to implement additional tools.\nI\'m also working on an agentic VS COde extension but more of that at a later date\n\nHow I scope work:\n• Start with the bottleneck: retrieval? experiment count? brittle handoffs? We pick one.\n• Ship a small, working prototype fast; measure; iterate; document; hand over.\n• Keep IP, license usage; be transparent; avoid vendor lock where we can.\n• Strong SoWs; clean docs; and honest conversations about risk, safety, and fit.\n\n—\nAchievements I’m proud of (because they changed behaviour)\n—\n• 4th place in a Kaggle binary‑classification competition (Mar 2025) — a nice reminder that fundamentals matter.\n• Modal Labs Choice Award ($5,000) for an agentic Model Context Protocol (MCP) server during a Gradio + Hugging Face\n  hackathon (Jul 2025). The joy wasn’t the prize — it was proving a lean, useful pattern quickly with real constraints.\n• The Bayesian optimisation result at AZ (same optimum, ~50% fewer experiments) because it moved from “cool idea” to\n  “how we actually work”. It was the first of its type in the department and I learned a lot from Bayesian experts\n• The RAG assistant because it reduced real, everyday friction for colleagues hunting for knowledge in complex systems. The\ntools I develop are thought of with the end user in mind, how can I try and make someones day better by helping them solve a problem.\n\n—\nWhy AI — and why now\n—\nAnalytical chemistry immersed me in noisy data and decisions under constraint. Statistics gave me language for uncertainty.\nPython gave me leverage — automation, analysis, and APIs. ML stitched it together into predictive systems. GenAI widened\nthe aperture to text and reasoning, and agentic patterns turn tools into coordinated doers. To be honest, I enjoy the loop:\nframe the question, ship a tiny thing, see if it helps, and keep going. Programming is one of those activities I can start and\nall of a sudden its 8 hours later and thats what I love about it, it tunes my brain, my brain was made to code, its just a shame\nI found out so late.\n\n—\nHow I work (and sound)\n—\n• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I\'m always thinking about how things can be done better\n• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I\'ll fixate on it until its done\n• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes\n• I\'m honest, if somethings my fault, I\'ll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me\n• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.\n• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on\n• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.\n\n—\nTechnical highlights (deeper cuts)\n—\nRAG laboratory assistant\nWhy: People were wasting time on “Who knows X?” and “Where’s that doc?”. Retrieval needed to be first‑class.\nHow: Light doc loaders; chunking; embeddings; vector DB; retrieval‑augmented prompting; guardrails around sources;\nsimple UI; risk assessments; evaluation vs expected outputs; UAT with actual users.\nOutcome: ~20% reduction in troubleshooting lead times and noticeably faster answers to routine questions.\nHow I did it: I built a PoC using Streamlit. I used Open AI embeddings to vectorise manuals and troubleshooting guides that I\nselected from the internet, knowing that these ground truth documents were great sources. What do you do with embeddings, put\nthem in a vector database, personally I used ChromaDB because it was easy to set up locally but I have also used QDrant and Pinecone\nwhich are great cloud alternatives. Then I had to layer in the LLM calls. To improve accuracy, I employed a prompt augmentation step,\nI make an extra call to an LLM, to come up with 3 or 4 questions related to the user query but slightly different. This helps to widen the potential \nretrieval of documents, especially if it asks questions the user hadnt thought of, its all about context. From this you can inject this into the prompt\nand get a grounded answer (although you gotta cal set() on those retrieved chunks, dont want to waste tokens on duplicated lol).\nI also included image based troubleshooting, early on in the multimodal landscape. Image embeddings wernt common then, so I used models to explain the issue\nin the image and then used this context to perform retrieval, this meant it could be quite dynamic and still give ground truth results with references (key).\nThe other main input into this type of tool, prompt engineering, users dont want to type war and piece, by having a specialist RAG tool you can fine fune the system\nprompt to abstract away some of the more complex prompting skills like chain of thought, its been done form them already.\nThats just the PoC, AI governance is key, copyright concerns is key. Deployment becomes a collaborative effort with teams all over the world, sprints in Jira\nUAT with SME\'s, AI evaluation rounds with SME\'s to make sure responses meet requirements. FInally you get an app out in the wild and people start using it\nfeels great!!\n\nAgentic workflows + MCP/tool‑use\nWhy: Multi‑step, cross‑system tasks were brittle and person‑dependent.\nHow: Orchestrated tools behind clear interfaces; used MCP/tool‑use patterns so models can call functions securely; kept\nscope tight.\nOutcome: In the right slices, up to ~80% reduction in human loops to reach usable results.\n\nBayesian optimisation for method development\nWhy: Parameter spaces are expensive to explore; we needed a principled way to reach “good enough to ship” faster.\nHow: Replayed a historical development on the same instrument with bounded variables and a clear objective; ran an\niterative loop; compared against the known optimum.\nOutcome: Same optimum with ~50% fewer experiments. Clear signal to scale into practice.\n\nChromatographic retention‑time prediction\nWhy: Better priors mean fewer dead‑ends in method development.\nHow: Start with fingerprints + XGBoost baselines; extend to neural models; then pre‑train a graph model with attention on\n~70k open injections; fine‑tune on internal ~30k; evaluate on held‑out chemistries.\nOutcome: Stronger generalisation and a reusable domain foundation to build on.\n\nAPIs & ETL correctness\nWhy: Analysts shouldn’t screen‑scrape or wrestle nested XML‑ish blobs. Clean tables + typed APIs unlock everything.\nHow: FastAPI with Pydantic models; raised/resolved flattening issues so SQL was sane; wrote small services people\ncould actually call.\nOutcome: Less friction; fewer bespoke scripts; more reliable dashboards and models.\n\n—\nWhat’s next\n—\nMore agentic workflows wired to real systems; more explicit data contracts; and more public sharing of light‑weight tools\nand patterns.

Accounting via QuickBooks; banking via Starling (sole trader).\n\n—\nEngagement Policy (Ethics & Fit)\n—\nRed lines: no fossil fuels, weapons/arms, or harmful surveillance/abusive tech; avoid organisations and conflicts that contradict a people-first stance.\nAmbers: ad tech, scraping of private data without consent, high-risk medical claims — require strict scoping, governance and auditability.\nGreens: health & life sciences; education & upskilling; charities & non-profits; SMEs doing practical automation; research tooling.\nDefaults: minimal lock-in; clear IP/licensing; privacy-by-design; evals and guardrails for GenAI; documented handovers with maintainers named.\n\n—\nTeaching & Mentoring\n—\nI explain as I build: diagrams, notebooks, READMEs, and handover sessions. I mentor through internal coding groups, \nco-design small exercises, and prefer “show, don’t tell.” My Guyana year made me comfortable teaching under constraints; \nat work I apply the same approach — tight feedback loops, simple interfaces, and momentum.\n\n—\nPersonal Tech Lab (Home Server & Experiments)\n—\nI tinker. I run a Mac Mini home server (Jellyfin, n8n, Nextcloud, Pi‑hole, Home Assistant, web servers) and keep a Raspberry Pi 4B (SSD-boot) for small \nautomations. It’s where I test agents, RAG patterns, and light-weight services before hardening them for work.\n\nI have an LLM lab for local models (RTX 3090). I\'ve successfully run fine tuning and reinforcement learning using an open source Gemma model. I called this \nmodel ChemGemma having curated a dataset from HuggingFace to perform supervised fine tuning and RL using GRPO to add reasoning.\n\n—\nn8n Systems: Daily arXiv Scraper & RAG Pipeline\n—\nI’ve built a set of n8n flows that keep me and my tools up to date with AI/CS/DS research and make that corpus queryable.\n\n1) Daily arXiv Scraper (image: /mnt/data/db5d6387-16a9-4004-8a7b-6663d15217a2.png)\nGoal: pull fresh research (AI/CS/DS), normalise it with an LLM, store summaries/metadata in Notion, and index the text in a vector store for search and RAG.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Schedule Trigger → RSS Read: runs daily, fetching new arXiv entries from feeds I care about.\n• Loop Over Items: iterates papers.\n• Message a model (Message Model): composes a clean prompt per item with extracted metadata.\n• AI Agent (Chat Model + Tools): calls an OpenAI chat model; reaches out via an HTTP Request node when extra info is needed (e.g., to fetch the abstract or PDF link); produces structured JSON (title, authors, abstract, URL, categories, license hints).\n• Structured Output Parser: enforces the schema and catches malformed outputs.\n• If (branch): routes by licence/permissiveness or other policy flags.\n• Create a database page (Notion): two variants of the Notion writer — one for permissive/common licences, another for restricted — so that only permissive-license papers are fully “stored” and enriched (restricted ones get a link-only/metadata card).\n• Merge: folds both branches back into a single stream.\n• Qdrant Vector Store: chunk + embed the permitted text (abstract/fulltext when allowed) using OpenAI embeddings; write vectors and metadata for retrieval later.\nResult: a clean, daily-updated Notion knowledge base + vector index of papers I’m allowed to store, with policy-respecting handling of licences. It’s simple, fast to audit, and easy to extend.\n\n2) RAG Query Pipeline (image: /mnt/data/b503029c-a157-4c48-9a40-5271840d4327.png)\nGoal: ask natural-language questions over the paper corpus with transparent retrieval and guardrails.\n\nHigh-level steps in the flow:\n• Webhook: entry-point for a query (from my portal or CLI).\n• PromptAugmentation: uses a chat model to clean/expand the user prompt (e.g., add synonyms, normalise acronyms) and emits a structured plan via a Structured Output Parser.\n• Code: tiny glue to format search queries and pass control values (k, filters).\n• Loop Over Items: if the plan has multiple sub-queries, iterate them.\n• AI Agent: coordinates two tools — (a) Qdrant Vector Store search with OpenAI embeddings; (b) a Cohere re-ranker for higher precision.\n• Aggregate → Message a model → Respond to Webhook: aggregates top contexts, prompts the model to answer with citations and explicit “what I don’t know,” then returns the response JSON to the caller.\nDesign choices:\n• Retrieval is explicit: top-k, distances/scores, and doc IDs logged.\n• Re-ranking improves answer quality without overloading the LLM.\n• Style/guardrails: British spelling, direct tone; citations mandatory; no hallucinated claims beyond the retrieved contexts.\n\nImpact:\n• I don’t waste time manually scanning feeds; new work lands in Notion and the vector store each morning.\n• I can query “What’s new on tool-use/MCP for agents?” and get a grounded answer with links.\n• The same index powers demos and internal RAG utilities — a single source of truth.\n\n—\nWhat I’m Open To\n—\n• Roles: AI Engineer / ML Engineer / Data Scientist (UK-remote or North West hybrid); short build engagements for copilots, RAG, and agentic automations.\n• Pro bono: time-boxed PoCs for UK charities and mission-led organisations.\n• Collaborations: research tooling, open-source scaffolding, educational content.\n\n—\nWhy I Love to Code (and the Thing I Obsess About)\n—\nI love writing Python and shipping small tools that unblock people — it’s the quickest route from “problem” to “better.” \nI tend to obsess about the bottleneck: if it’s retrieval, I build RAG; if it’s too many experiments, I reach for Bayesian optimisation; \nif it’s brittle handoffs, I ship a typed API. Solving problems is the through-line for me — discreet questions, clear interfaces, \nquick feedback, and steady iteration.\n\n—\nSport & Judo\n—\nI’m into sport — football, rugby, Formula 1, and most things with a scoreboard. As a teenager I was a judoka: \nI earned my black belt at 16 (the youngest age you can), won medals across the country, including a bronze at an \ninternational competition in London, and trained as a coach for my local club. It taught me discipline, composure under pressure, a\nnd how to learn by doing — lessons I still apply daily.\n\n\n## LinkedIn Profile:\n\xa0 \xa0\nContact\nplyerd88@hotmail.co.uk\nwww.linkedin.com/in/danielhalwell\n(LinkedIn)\nTop Skills\nLarge Language Models (LLM)\nOpenAI API\nAnthropic API\nCertifications\nDocker\nMember of the Royal Society of\nChemistry\nIBM RAG and Agentic AI\nMicrosoft Python Development\nPublications\nImpact of the Extraction Technique\non data obtained for Nasal Product\nBooklet Labels\nRelationship between Human Taste\nPerception and the Persistence of\nUmami Compounds in the Mouth\nDaniel Halwell\nSenior Analytical Scientist | AI Solutions Developer (CoDHe Labs)\nNorthwich, England, United Kingdom\nSummary\nAt AstraZeneca, my focus has been on pushing the boundaries\nof analytical chemistry, particularly in the realm of extractable and\nleachable (E&L) studies.
