AstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code
—
This is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations
where timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.
One of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations
it requires specific methods and equipment, we're talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do
is automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,
this is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact.

• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I'm always thinking about how things can be done better
• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I'll fixate on it until its done
• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes
• I'm honest, if somethings my fault, I'll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me
• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.
• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on
• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.

One of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations
it requires specific methods and equipment, we're talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do

Senior Scientist — AstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present), Macclesfield
- Core focus: analytical chemistry integrated with data science/engineering. I lead method development and validation for trace analysis (UPLC, GC, GC‑MS, LC‑MS/MS), with particular emphasis on nitrosamine investigations at very low concentrations.
- Automation & data work: I apply Python for data pipelines, ML, visualization and Generative AI to speed up routine work and decision‑making. Examples include Bayesian optimisation of method parameters, chromatographic prediction models (XGBoost and neural nets), and building REST APIs (FastAPI) to integrate analytical data.
- Knowledge systems & tooling: built a RAG (retrieval‑augmented generation) chatbot for lab knowledge management, worked with LLMs/agentic workflows and Copilot Studio to improve lab support and automation.
- Cross‑functional & regulated work: provide technical support for GMP inspections and urgent manufacturing problems, perform non‑routine analysis, method transfers/validations, investigations and CAPA work; I also mentor colleagues on data and automation practices.
- Technologies: HPLC, GC‑MS, LC‑MS/MS, Python, SQL, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, FastAPI, ML toolkits.

2025-09-28 16:33:26,108 INFO utils.app_logging: User: How would you design a small RAG pipeline for docs?
2025-09-28 16:33:27,100 INFO utils.app_logging: Guardrails response: Neutral True -> True
2025-09-28 16:33:47,249 INFO utils.app_logging: Assistant final response: Great question — here’s a compact, practical design for a small RAG pipeline for documents, based on my RAG Query Pipeline and ingestion flow (see my notes on the RAG Query Pipeline and the daily ingest pipeline). I’ll give the architecture, component responsibilities, concrete tech choices, tuning knobs and guardrails.

High-level architecture
- Ingest → Chunk & Embed → Vector Store → Retriever (+ optional re‑ranker) → Prompt Augmentation → Model Synthesiser → API/Webhook
- Persistence: raw docs (object store), chunks & vectors (vector DB + metadata), provenance & logs (SQL/Notion/Elasticsearch)

Components & responsibilities
1. Ingest
- Sources: local docs, PDFs, S3, Google Drive, Notion, or HTTP endpoints.
- Extract text (pdfminer / tika / pypdf) and metadata (title, author, date, licence).
- Run a licence check / permissiveness branch (store full text only if licence permits) — inspired by my daily arXiv flow.

2. Chunking & filtering
- Split into semantic chunks (typical 500–1,000 tokens) with overlap (50–200 tokens) to preserve context.
- Remove boilerplate and near-duplicates; store original doc id + chunk offsets in metadata.

3. Embeddings & vector storage
- Create embeddings (OpenAI embeddings or another provider). Write vectors + metadata to Qdrant / Chroma / FAISS.
- Log embedding model, vector id, and insert time.

4. Retriever & re‑ranking
- Retriever: top_k search (start k=10).
- Optional re‑ranker: pass top candidates to a re‑ranker (Cohere or a small cross-encoder) to improve precision without expanding LLM context load — this mirrors my RAG Query Pipeline design.
- Always retain scores/distances and doc IDs for auditing.

5. Prompt augmentation & planning
- Clean/expand the user prompt (acronyms, synonyms) with a small chat model to create a structured plan (e.g., sub-queries), then build retrieval queries.
- Use a Structured Output Parser (Pydantic/JSON-schema) for predictable LLM outputs and to catch malformed responses.

6. Response synthesis
- Aggregate top contexts, construct a prompt that:
  - Shows the retrieved excerpts with citations (doc id + chunk positions),
  - Asks the model to state uncertainty explicitly (“what I don’t know”),
  - Uses guardrails (style: British spelling, concise, no hallucinations).
- Produce final answer + list of cited sources and retrieval scores.

7. API / UI
- Expose via a FastAPI webhook (typed with Pydantic) that:
  - Accepts query, user constraints (e.g., max sources), and returns answer + citations + provenance.
- Add rate-limiting, auth, and request logging.

Operational & design choices (practical knobs)
- Chunk size: 500–1,000 tokens; overlap 50–200 tokens.
- top_k: 8–12 for retrieval; re-rank to reduce to 3–5 to send to the model.
- Embedding model: current OpenAI embedding (or provider equivalent).
- Vector DB: Qdrant (good balance of features / hosted options).
- Orchestration: simple cron / n8n or a small Dockerised job (I use n8n / lightweight cron patterns).
- Monitoring: log retrieval IDs, distances, timestamps, prompt used and model outputs for auditing.
- CI: tests for chunking correctness, embedding stability, and sample Q->A drift.

Guardrails & provenance (important)
- Mandatory citations — each factual claim tied back to source chunks.
- “What I don’t know” section in every reply.
- Licence-aware storage (only store fulltext where permitted).
- Explicit logging of retrieval scores/distances and doc IDs for traceability.

Minimal tech stack (example)
- Python, FastAPI, Pydantic for API/schema
- OpenAI embeddings / OpenAI chat (or Anthropic)
- Qdrant for vector store
- Cohere or small cross-encoder for re‑ranking (optional)
- Docker, GitHub Actions for CI
- Notion/SQL for metadata & small knowledge base
This matches my notes on languages/tools and the RAG Query Pipeline design choices.

Next steps I can take for you
- Sketch a minimal repo layout + small example app (FastAPI + Qdrant + OpenAI embedding + simple prompt flow).
- Share a notebook demonstrating ingestion → chunk → embed → retrieve → response.

Would you like a starter repo and code snippets (FastAPI + Qdrant + OpenAI) tailored to your document types? If so, tell me the document formats and preferred hosting (local / cloud), and I’ll prepare it — or email me at danielhalwell@gmail.com.

- Data/automation: build Python tools, REST APIs (FastAPI) and data pipelines to automate data ingestion and instrument log processing; apply machine learning (XGBoost, neural nets) for chromatographic prediction and Bayesian optimisation to streamline method development.
- RAG / generative AI work: designed a RAG chatbot for laboratory knowledge management and other agentic/automation workflows to help scientists find protocols and instrument guidance.
- Tech stack: HPLC, GC‑MS, LC‑MS/MS, Python, SQL, TensorFlow/PyTorch, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, LangChain, FastAPI, Copilot Studio.
- Impact: faster method development cycles, better trace analysis reliability, and improved lab knowledge access for colleagues.

CoDHe Labs — AI Engineer (part‑time, Jul 2025 – present)
- Advisory work implementing responsible generative AI (RAG systems, chatbots, automation) for charities and small organisations.
- Pro bono AI consulting and hands‑on model/data work using the same ML/LLM toolchain I use in pharma projects.
