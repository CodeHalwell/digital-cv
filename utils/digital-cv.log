AstraZeneca (May 2021 – Present, Macclesfield): chemistry meets code
—
This is where everything clicked. I stayed rooted in analytical science — including trace/nitrosamine risk investigations
where timelines are tight — but I worked increasingly like a data scientist / engineer.
One of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations
it requires specific methods and equipment, we're talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do
is automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,
this is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact.

• “What does success look like in a year, what skill will I need in 6 months?” — then work backwards. I'm always thinking about how things can be done better
• Start small and see where it goes. If its good, I'll fixate on it until its done
• Nothing is ever good enough, we can always improve on processes
• I'm honest, if somethings my fault, I'll hold my hand up and expect the same of others. Pushing blame onto others or nitpicking people doesnt impress me
• Opinionated defaults, but collaborative. I’ll propose a pattern and then adapt with the team.
• Documentation is part of delivery. If someone can’t pick it up without me, I haven’t finished and thats hard to follow through on
• I’ll say “Yeah, definitely,” when something resonates. I’ll say “to be honest,” when I need to cut through nicely.

High-level summary
- Core responsibilities: analytical method development and validation for drug substance and drug product using UPLC, GC, MS and MS/MS, with a focus on trace analysis (e.g., nitrosamines); non-routine analysis and extractables & leachables (E&L) scoping and interpretation; method transfers and regulatory/GMP inspection support.
- Digital & data-science work: building ML models (XGBoost, neural nets) for chromatographic prediction; Bayesian optimization to streamline workflows; Python-based tooling for machine learning, data visualization and Generative AI; built REST APIs with FastAPI for analytical data integration; developed a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) chatbot for laboratory knowledge management.
- Key achievements: led E&L studies and method transfers, developed predictive models for chromatography, implemented automated data workflows and lab-facing AI tools to improve knowledge access and efficiency.
- Technologies: HPLC/UPLC, GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, Python, SQL, FastAPI, TensorFlow/PyTorch (ML), OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, RAG/Copilot Studio, statistical methods for validation.

I also do part‑time AI advisory work for CoDHe Labs (from July 2025) helping organisations implement responsible generative AI and RAG systems.

High-level summary
- Role focus: design, prototype, and productionize RAG systems, automation pipelines, and pragmatic AI tooling that solve real product or business problems.
- Responsibilities: end-to-end system design (data ingestion → embedding → retrieval → LLM orchestration), prompt engineering, model selection/tuning, building evaluation/monitoring, and deploying reliable infra for production usage.
- Typical stack/tools: Python, embeddings & vector stores (FAISS/Pinecone/Weaviate), LangChain-style orchestration, OpenAI / open models, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD, Terraform for infra, plus SQL/NoSQL for data plumbing.
- Outcomes I prioritize: fast iteration from prototype → production, maintainable systems, measurable improvements in user/task efficiency, and clear evaluation/monitoring for model behavior.

If you want specifics — team size, a concrete project example, or measurable outcomes — I can share those. You can also email me at danielhalwell@gmail.com for more detail or to request a resume.

One of my key tasks is method devlopment of extremely low concentrations. Nitrosamine have to be monitored at such low concentrations
it requires specific methods and equipment, we're talking levels of around a billionth of a gram. The one thing we can always do
is automate better, which is what I love to do. Whether its processing ticket requests or extracting instrument usage from logs,
this is where my programming knowledge really started to make an impact.

Subject‑matter lead for E&L studies, scoping and interpreting chromatographic &\n  spectroscopic data for materials such as plastics and elastomers. I worked with suppliers to perform testing\n  on out behalf, draw up protocols and reports, kept up to date on the latest advancements\n• Method transfers & validation. Equivalence testing, t‑tests, TOST, precision/accuracy studies, technical reports,\n  and document control in a cGxP environment. This is another stage in my career where statistics is pushing me\n  towards a career in data science and AI. I didnt quite know it yet but I loved maths more than I thought I did.\n  I was one of the technical experts when we transferred around 60 methods to Germany following potential rule\n  changes after Brexit. This made me a key contact for troubleshooting, acceptance criteria setting, result interpretation,\n  I travelled to Germany to train staff, a bit of everything.\n• Investigations & CAPA. Practical Problem Solving (PPS), root‑cause analysis across engineering, manufacturing,\n  and quality.\n• Manufacturing support. Collaborated with scientists, engineers, and microbiologists on urgent issues — from chemical\n  impurities to microbial contamination — often building or adapting analytical methods on the fly. I'd be testing effluent\n  one day and have my head in a metered dose inhaler formulation vessel the next.\n\n[2] Source: me/summary.txt#chunk-7 (score: 1.428)\n—\nA practical reset: labouring on a building site\n—\n[Metadata]\nExec summary: Highlights Daniel’s post-graduation labouring work, underscoring appreciation for tangible progress and parallels to iterative software development.\nKeywords: labouring, construction, tangible progress, iteration, motivation, work ethic\nQuestions:\n1.

Why does iterative build-test cycles resonate with Daniel?\n[/Metadata]\nAfter graduating, I worked as a labourer in Devon while job‑hunting — hauling materials through houses to back gardens,\nmixing cement for brickwork and infill, clearing waste. Tangible progress at the end of each day is addictive. I still chase\nthat in software: Its great to see progress when you finish at the end of the day, those small iterative cycles of build, debug\n, test repeat keeps me addicted to writing code.\n—\nSanofi → Recipharm (2012–2021): analytical specialist in a regulated world\n—\n[Metadata]\nExec summary: Summarises nearly a decade of analytical chemistry work at Sanofi and Recipharm, covering E&L leadership, method transfers, investigations, and cross-functional support in regulated environments.\nKeywords: Sanofi, Recipharm, analytical specialist, extractables and leachables, method validation, cGxP, investigations, manufacturing support, statistics\nQuestions:\n1.
